# Project Pitch

## Pitch

Our team aims to create a 2D side scroller shooter action game where the player will clear enemies while avoiding said enemies.

## Outline

We will incorporate basic shapes as the prototype, and compound shapes for more advanced enemies. The player and player projectiles will also utilize the same visual interface, and interaction (the kill state) for the enemies and projectiles will be implemented via this interface. At regular intervals, such as at the beginning and end of a stage, we will incorporate a save state function so the player can resume at their latest game stage. At the same time, we will implement a score function that will keep track of the playerâ€™s current score, incrementing based on the number and type of enemies eradicated. In order to fulfill different types of scoring, we will have a selection of enemies that show up depending on the stage and timing of the game. Triggers that spawn these enemies might include timers, and/or a kill state of other enemies.
